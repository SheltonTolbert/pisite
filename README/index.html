<p>
welcome to my website. it is currently very under construction - i'm still working out what i want it to be.
</p>

<p>
you are currently in a raspberry pi tucked away in the closet, behind my fiance's track suits.

<p>
my name is shelton, i am a full-stack (is it fullstack, full stack, or full-stack? i don't know!) engineer at dscout.
my day to day consists of building on a react application that researchers across the country use
to conduct qualitative research with everyday people. specifically, i work on the part of the application that involves
connecting our research participants, we call them scouts, with the researchers that use our platform.

<p>
thanks for stopping by and about the dust!
